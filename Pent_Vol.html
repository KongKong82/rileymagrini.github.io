										<h3 class="major">Why make a volume?</h3>
										<h4>Not because it's an easy project, but because I thought it would be an easy project.</h4>
										<p>For a couple years I worked at my universities rock climbing wall. Part of my job while working there was setting new routes for people to climb. It was definitely my one of my favorite parts of the job, however, there were only a limited number of face geometries the wall had that we could set on. This led to many routes feeling repetitive on parts of the wall that had similar geometry. There are two main ways to fix this issue.</p>
										<li>Become a better routesetter and find creative solutions to make a bland section of the wall more interesting</li>
										<li>Get new holds that change how that section of wall can be used as a climber</li>
										<p><br>Because I was a relatively new setter and at the time the wall's management was cutting back on the ammount of times we got to set, the quickest option to set more interesting climbs was to create a volume from scratch.</p>
										<h5>But what's a volume?</h5>
										<p>In the world of indoor rock climbing, a volume is a feature that setters can use to add complex geometry to a wall's surface. Typically routes would be set by color, where only one color is used for each route. Volumes, however, are usually able to be used for every route, essentially becoming an extension of the wall itself. Furthermore, volumes can also have regular holds attatched to them, allowing for holds to be placed at new angles that weren't previously possible on particular sections of the wall.</p>
										<p>So then the answer to my problem of mediocre routesetting is to make a volume! Easy!</p>

										<h4></h4>
										<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Projects/Pent_Vol/CAD.jpg" alt="Cad Model of Volume" />Cad Model of Volume<br></span>Now I need to start laying out the volume. To make something usable and easily manufacturable, it can't be too big. I'm a broke college student and can't go run to home depot for every weekend project I concieve, so this will have to be made out of scrap pieces of wood I have lying around.<br>
										It also will have to be carried up the wall by the people who are setting with it, and large volumes are a pain to work with when setting on a 40 foot high wall. Hazards to the climber also have to be considered. If the volume sticks out from the wall too much, it will be easy for a setter to unintentially put it in a location that complicates lead routes or worse, becomes a genuine hazard for breaking ankles when climbers are taking falls<br>
										Taking this into consideration, I decided to create a volume that was just over 2 feet wide and 6 inches tall. To make the volume a little more interesting than the typical triangular pyramids commonly used, I designed my volume to be a pentagon.</p>
										<p><span class="image right"><img src="images\Projects\Pent_Vol\IMG_2099.jpg" alt="Drawing of Volume" />Drawing of Volume</span>Once I made the CAD I created some quick drawings with critical dimensions that I could reference when actually making the volume.<br>
										Now that I have some physical drawings I can take into the workshop and a CAD I can reference if needed, I can finally get to making some sawdust!</p>

										<h4></h4>
										<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Projects/Pent_Vol/IMG_2100.jpg" alt="Individual Parts Cut Out" />Individual Parts Cut Out</span>After finding some scrap pieces of plywood I had from other projects, I started cutting based on the drawings of the CAD. I used a table saw for the large pentagon, cutting at an angle so that all the pieces could be joined together easily. I used a miter saw for the smaller pieces, again cutting at an angle so that when assembled the faces will be flush with each other. Once all the pieces were cut to the right shape, I drilled mounting holes into the pieces with a drill press.</p>
										<p><pre>



										</pre></p>
										<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/Projects/Pent_Vol/IMG_2101.jpg" alt="Parts Being Joined Together" />Parts Being Joined Together</span>Once all the pieces were cut and drilled I started to put them together using a combination of wood glue, small nails, and screws. I went a little overboard in the joining process because if the volume were to fail people could potentially be seriously injured.<br></p>
										<p>Once all the joinery was done, I added wood putty to the holes made by the nails and screws. My goal was to make the volume as smooth as possible. If there were unintentional holes left, climbers would be able to grab on to the small textures, giving them an unintentional advantage when climbing the route. If any surface were to stick out from the volume, it could become a scraping risk to the climber. <br></p>
										<p>After the wood putty dried, I sanded the roughest parts of the volume with 200 grit sandpaper. Once the large features on the surface were removed I moved on to 400 then 600 grit to ensure the surface of the volume was as smooth as possible.</p>
										<p><pre>


										</pre></p>
										<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Projects/Pent_Vol/IMG_2106.jpg" alt="Primer Going On" />Primer Going On</span>Once the surface was nice and smooth after hours of sanding, it was time to start layering on some primer.</p>
										<h5>But why use primer? Isn't that more expensive than just going straight to painting?</h5>
										<p>Yes it is! However, it will be worth it. Volumes have to take a lot of abuse. People will potentially be falling on it, stepping on it, jumping off it, and gripping it with their fingernails for dear life. If I were to slap a layer of base paint on, it would be fine for a couple of weeks sure, but it would be a miracle if it lasted more than a few months. Primer allows for the paint to adhere better to the surface of the volume.<br></p>
										<p>I also could have used a protective coating to do the same job, or a mix of both. For this project I chose to just stick with the primer because it would make the volume look nice after the paint is applied. This may be suprising to hear but it's also what I had readily available at the time.<br></p>
										<p><pre>

										</pre></p>
										<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/Projects/Pent_Vol/IMG_2107.jpg" alt="Paint Going On" />Paint Going On</span>Once the primer had gone on, dried, and been sanded a few times I could start layering on the final coats of paint. The finish line was in sight! I chose to paint it black so that it wouldn't clash with the wall's colors or be confused with other climbs.</p>

										<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Projects/Pent_Vol/IMG_2113.jpg" alt="Volume On Wall" />Volume On Climbing Wall</span>Awesome! The volume is finished! Now all that's left is to make sure that it won't fail as soon as people start to pull on it with their entire body weight.<br><br>
										I went to the wall and bolted my volume in. I put a huge jug [easy to hang on to hold] in the middle of the volume and began stress testing it as well as I could. I put my feel up on the wall and tried to pry it off, but the thing wouldn't budge! After my friends and I took turns trying our hardest to break the volume off the wall, we took it off and began taking turns jumping on it, testing how well it could stand up to high impact settings.<br><br>
										After an unsuccessful session of trying to destroy the volume, the lead routesetter was convinced that it was safe enough to use on a real route. Just in case, though, I used it as a starting hold close to the ground on the first route that used it. That way if it were to break the debris wouldn't rain down on unsuspecting climbers and gymgoers.</p>
