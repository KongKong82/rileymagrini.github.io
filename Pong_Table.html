										<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Projects/Pong_Table/IMG_2852.JPG" alt="3D model of cup pong table" />CAD of cup pong table</span>I designed the cup pong table using a free online software called ONSHAPE. The reason for using ONSHAPE was that the SOLIDWORKS license I had from school had run out and none of my classes at the time allowed for me to get a new one. Furthermore, I won't be able to use SOLIDWORKS after I graduate so I wanted to test out the CAD software to see if it was something I would want to use in the future. A key design consideration for the table was its durability. I was planning on having this be an outside table so it was likely that a person may feel compelled to climb on top of it. In order to ensure that person's safety as well as those nearby the table while people are standing on it, the table was designed to be grossly oversupported in case such an event were to occur.</p>

										<h4></h4>
										<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Projects/Pong_Table/IMG_2929.jpg" alt="Table Top Frame" />Table Frame</span>After the CAD for the table was finished, I hit the hardware store and bought some 2x4's and 4x4's as well as a plywood sheet, some thinner wood to use as trim, paint, and some screws and nails. With all my supplies I went home and started cutting the wood to the size described in the CAD model. Once the pieces were cut to length my roommate and I started to nail the fram together. The frame in the real world ended up being a lot simpler than in the CAD. The reason for this is to minimize the amount of individual parts which equates to less parts to cut which means there are less parts that can potentially be cut wrong. This also cuts down on the ammount of nails my roommate and I will have to hammer in which he appreciated. With the exception of the reinforcement, the table's frame was assembled using the CAD as a reference.</p>

										<h3 class="major">Finishing Touches</h3>
										<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/Projects/Pong_Table/FINAL.jpg" alt="First layer of black paint"/></span>After the table was fully assembled, I sanded the top surface as well as sanded a fillet on the edges of the table so that is was comfortable for people to lean against. Once the table was sanded and dusted, it was finally time for the paint to go on. I wanted to paint my universities logo on to the table so I started with a base layer of black. Contrary to my climbing volume project, I chose to not use a primer on the table. The reason for this is because the table is going to be outside in the backyard year-round, so I will be applying protective layers of deck coatings so that the table could be protected from the sun and rain. I thought it would be a litter overkill to use both a primer and a protective outdoor coating for just a table, hence why the primer was left out of this project. After a week of painting, waiting, and painting again, the table's final appearance came together to make a pretty great cup pong table!<pre>
